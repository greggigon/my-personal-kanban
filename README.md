## Adding Themes

Themes are just a simple CSS files. They should be put in the __styles/themes__ folder. New Theme should be added to __scripts/themes.js__ file. Also, a Theme image (jpg) can be placed in __img/themes__ folder. Name of the image should be the same as the __css__ attribute in the themes.js file.

## A bit of history

I started this little project 2 years ago when I decided to familiarise myself with HTML5, Pure JavaScript and CSS.

I used jQuery with QUnit for JavaScript TDD testing.

I managed to get it to a workable state and stop developing it.

After first public release not too long ago, I decided to rewrite it in __Angular__.

This application is the result of me doing so, while attempting to learn Angular at the same time :)
